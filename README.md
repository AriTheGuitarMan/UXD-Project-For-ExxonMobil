# UXD-Project-For-ExxonMobil
UXD Semester Project Creating A Product For ExxonMobil To Increase Efficiency In Event Handling

The design challenge was to develop an interface that allows ExxonMobil employees to create and manage company events. The interface needed to be able to accommodate company events of all types and sizes, and support events with multiple sessions and locations. Additionally, it needed to automate the process of event registration and the management of waitlists.

The dynamic prototype of the final product can be viewed in the Dynamic Prototype zip file. Also, the contents of that file have been unzipped in the repository.
